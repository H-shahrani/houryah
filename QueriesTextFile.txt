Question 1

We want to understand more about the movies that families are watching. The following categories are considered family movies: Animation, Children, Classics, Comedy, Family and Music.

Create a query that lists each movie, the film category it is classified in, and the number of times it has been rented out.

 /*Query 1/*

WITH title_category AS(
                SELECT f.film_id, f.title AS film_title, cat.name AS category_name
                 FROM film f
                 JOIN film_category fc
                 ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
                 JOIN category cat
                 ON cat.category_id = fc.category_id
                 ORDER BY 2,3) ,

rent_count AS (
                SELECT f.film_id, COUNT(*) AS rental_count
                FROM film f
                JOIN inventory inv
                ON inv.film_id = f.film_id
                JOIN rental r
                ON inv.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
                GROUP BY 1)

SELECT film_title , category_name , rental_count
FROM title_category tc
JOIN rent_count rc
ON tc.film_id = rc.film_id
ORDER BY 2,1


Question 2

Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.


/*Query 2/*

SELECT film.title , cat.name ,film.rental_duration,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY film.rental_duration)  AS standard_quartile
FROM film
JOIN film_category fc
ON film.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN category cat
ON cat.category_id = fc.category_id
WHERE cat.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
ORDER BY 3


Question 3

Finally, provide a table with the family-friendly film category, each of the quartiles, and the corresponding count of movies within each combination of film category for each corresponding rental duration category. The resulting table should have three columns:
	•	Category
	•	Rental length category
	•	Count


/*Query 3/*

WITH film_quartile AS ( 
	SELECT film.title , cat.name ,film.rental_duration,
        NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY film.rental_duration) AS 						standard_quartile
	FROM film
	JOIN film_category fc
	ON film.film_id = fc.film_id
	JOIN category cat
	ON cat.category_id = fc.category_id
	WHERE cat.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 			'Family', 'Music')
	ORDER BY 3 )

SELECT fq.name, fq.standard_quartile, COUNT(*)
FROM film_quartile fq
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2


Question 4:

We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for. Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders fulfilled during that month.

/*Query 4/*

SELECT rental_year, rental_month, store_id, 							COUNT(rental_month)
FROM (
  	SELECT DATE_PART('year',rental_date) AS rental_year,
			 DATE_PART('month',rental_date) AS rental_month,      			 store.store_id 
	FROM rental
	JOIN staff
	ON rental.staff_id = staff.staff_id
	JOIN store
	ON staff.store_id = store.store_id
	) rent_date
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 4 DESC
